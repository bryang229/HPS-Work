# About

This is a Clock PCB designed using KiCAD!

The code working with the clock is also included written in the arduino editor!

All parts in the clock are from [this library](https://github.com/hps-matthew/hps-kicad-library) (very useful !).

This is a project under the Hardware Product Spring program ! (Hence HPS) 

More documentation about the code is to come.
